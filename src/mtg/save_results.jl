    pre_allocate_outputs(statuses, outs, nsteps; check=true)

Pre-allocate the outputs of needed variable for each node type in vectors of vectors.
The first level vectors have length nsteps, and the second level vectors have length n_nodes of this type.

Note that we pre-allocate the vectors for the time-steps, but not for each organ, because we don't 
know how many nodes will be in each organ in the future (organs can appear or disapear).

# Arguments

- `statuses`: a dictionary of status by node type
- `outs`: a dictionary of outputs by node type
- `nsteps`: the number of time-steps
- `check`: whether to check the mapping for errors. Default (`true`) returns an error if some variables do not exist.
If false and some variables are missing, return an info, remove the unknown variables and continue.

# Returns

- A dictionary of pre-allocated output of vector of time-step and vector of node of that type.

# Examples

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> using PlantSimEngine, MultiScaleTreeGraph, PlantSimEngine.Examples
```

Import example models (can be found in the `examples` folder of the package, or in the `Examples` sub-modules): 

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> using PlantSimEngine.Examples;
```

Define the models mapping:

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> mapping = Dict( \
    "Plant" =>  ( \
        MultiScaleModel(  \
            model=ToyCAllocationModel(), \
            mapping=[ \
                :carbon_assimilation => ["Leaf"], \
                :carbon_demand => ["Leaf", "Internode"], \
                :carbon_allocation => ["Leaf", "Internode"] \
            ], \
        ), 
        MultiScaleModel(  \
            model=ToyPlantRmModel(), \
            mapping=[:Rm_organs => ["Leaf" => :Rm, "Internode" => :Rm],] \
        ), \
    ),\
    "Internode" => ( \
        ToyCDemandModel(optimal_biomass=10.0, development_duration=200.0), \
        ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel(1.5, 0.06, 25.0, 0.6, 0.004), \
        Status(TT=10.0, carbon_biomass=1.0) \
    ), \
    "Leaf" => ( \
        MultiScaleModel( \
            model=ToyAssimModel(), \
            mapping=[:soil_water_content => "Soil",], \
        ), \
        ToyCDemandModel(optimal_biomass=10.0, development_duration=200.0), \
        ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel(2.1, 0.06, 25.0, 1.0, 0.025), \
        Status(aPPFD=1300.0, TT=10.0, carbon_biomass=1.0), \
    ), \
    "Soil" => ( \
        ToySoilWaterModel(), \
    ), \
);
```

Importing an example MTG provided by the package:

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> mtg = import_mtg_example();
```

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> statuses, = PlantSimEngine.init_statuses(mtg, mapping);
```

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> outs = Dict("Leaf" => (:carbon_assimilation, :carbon_demand), "Soil" => (:soil_water_content,));
```

Pre-allocate the outputs as a dictionary:

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> preallocated_vars = PlantSimEngine.pre_allocate_outputs(statuses, outs, 2);
```

The dictionary has a key for each organ from which we want outputs:

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> collect(keys(preallocated_vars))
2-element Vector{String}:
 "Soil"
 "Leaf"
```

Each organ has a dictionary of variables for which we want outputs from, 
with the pre-allocated empty vectors (one per time-step that will be filled with one value per node):

```jldoctest mylabel
julia> collect(keys(preallocated_vars["Leaf"]))
3-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :carbon_assimilation
 :node
 :carbon_demand
```

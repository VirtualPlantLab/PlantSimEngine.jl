## What is multi-scale modeling? {#What-is-multi-scale-modeling?}

Multi-scale modeling is the process of simulating a system at multiple levels of detail simultaneously. For example, some models can run at the organ scale while others run at the plot scale. Each model can access variables at its scale and other scales if needed, allowing for a more comprehensive system representation. It can also help identify emergent properties that are not apparent at a single level of detail. 

For example, a model of photosynthesis at the leaf scale can be combined with a model of carbon allocation at the plant scale to simulate the growth and development of the plant. Another example is a combination of models to simulate the energy balance of a forest. To simulate it, you need a model for each organ type of the plant, another for the soil, and finally, one at the plot scale, integrating all others.

PlantSimEngine provides a framework for multi-scale modeling to seamlessly integrate models at different scales, keeping all nice functionalities provided at one scale. A nice feature is that models do not need to be aware of the scale at which they are running, nor about the scales at which their inputs are computed, or outputs will be given, which means the model can be reused at different scales or no scale.

PlantSimEngine automatically computes the dependency graph between mono and multi-scale models, considering every combination of models at any scale, to determine the order of model execution. This means that the user does not need to worry about the order of model execution and can focus on the model definition and the mapping between models and scales.

Using PlantSimEngine for multi-scale modeling is relatively easy and follows the same rules as mono-scale models. Let&#39;s dive into the details with a short tutorial.

## Simple mapping between models and scales {#Simple-mapping-between-models-and-scales}

To get started, we have to define a mapping between models and scales.

Let&#39;s import the `PlantSimEngine` package and example models we will use in this tutorial:

```julia
using PlantSimEngine
using PlantSimEngine.Examples # Import some example models
```


::: tip Note

The `Examples` submodule exports a few simple models we will use in this tutorial. The models are also found in the `examples` folder of the package.

:::

We now have access to models for the simulation of different processes. We can associate each model with a scale by defining a mapping between models and scales. The mapping is a dictionary with the name of the scale as the key and the model as the value. For example, we can define a mapping to simulate the assimilation process at the leaf scale with `ToyAssimModel` as follows:

```julia
mapping = Dict("Leaf" => ToyAssimModel())
```


```
Dict{String, PlantSimEngine.Examples.ToyAssimModel{Float64}} with 1 entry:
  "Leaf" => ToyAssimModel{Float64}(0.2)
```


In this example, the dictionary&#39;s key is the name of the scale (`"Leaf"`), and the value is the model. The model is an example model provided by `PlantSimEngine`, so we must prefix it with the module name.

We can check if the mapping is valid by calling `to_initialize`:

```julia
to_initialize(mapping)
```


```
Dict{String, Vector{Symbol}} with 1 entry:
  "Leaf" => [:aPPFD, :soil_water_content]
```


The `to_initialize` function checks if models from any scale need further initialization before simulation. This is the case when some input variables of the model are not computed by another model. In this example, the `ToyAssimModel` needs `:aPPFD` and `:soil_water_content` as inputs. To run a simulation, we must provide a value for the variables or a model that simulates them.

The initialization values for the variables can be provided using the `Status` type along with the model, _e.g._:

```julia
mapping = Dict(
    "Leaf" => (
        ToyAssimModel(),
        Status(aPPFD=1300.0, soil_water_content=0.5),
    ),
)
```


```
Dict{String, Tuple{PlantSimEngine.Examples.ToyAssimModel{Float64}, Status{(:aPPFD, :soil_water_content), Tuple{Base.RefValue{Float64}, Base.RefValue{Float64}}}}} with 1 entry:
  "Leaf" => (ToyAssimModel{Float64}(0.2), Status(aPPFD = 1300.0, soil_water_conâ€¦
```


::: tip Note

The model and the `Status` are provided as a `Tuple` to the `"Leaf"` scale.

:::

If we re-execute `to_initialize`, we get an empty dictionary, meaning the mapping is valid, and we can start the simulation:

```julia
to_initialize(mapping)
```


```
Dict{String, Vector{Symbol}}()
```


## Multiscale mapping between models and scales {#Multiscale-mapping-between-models-and-scales}

In our previous example, we provided the value for the `soil_water_content` variable. However, we could also provide a model that simulates it at the soil scale. The only difference now is that we have to tell PlantSimEngine that our  `ToyAssimModel` is now multiscale and takes the `soil_water_content` variable from the `"Soil"` scale. We can do that by wrapping the `ToyAssimModel` in a `MultiScaleModel`:

```julia
mapping = Dict(
    "Soil" => ToySoilWaterModel(),
    "Leaf" => (
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyAssimModel(),
            mapping=[:soil_water_content => "Soil" => :soil_water_content,],
        ),
        Status(aPPFD=1300.0),
    ),
);
```


The `MultiScaleModel` takes two arguments: the model and the mapping between the model and the scales. The mapping is a vector of pairs of pairs mapping the variable&#39;s name with the name of the scale its value comes from, and the name of the variable at that scale. In this example, we map the `soil_water_content` variable at scale &quot;Leaf&quot; to the `soil_water_content` variable at the `"Soil"` scale. If the name of the variable is the same between both scales, we can omit the variable name at the origin scale, _e.g._ `[:soil_water_content => "Soil"]`.

::: tip Note

The variable `aPPFD` is still provided in the `Status` type as a constant value.

:::

We can check again if the mapping is valid by calling `to_initialize`:

```julia
to_initialize(mapping)
```


```
Dict{String, Vector{Symbol}}()
```


`to_initialize` returns an empty dictionary, meaning the mapping is valid.

## More on MultiScaleModel {#More-on-MultiScaleModel}

`MultiScaleModel` is a wrapper around a model that allows it to take inputs or give outputs from other scales. It takes two arguments: the model and the mapping between the model and the scales. The mapping is a vector of pairs of pairs mapping the variable&#39;s name with the name of the scale its value comes from, and its name at that scale.

The variable can map a single value if there is only one node to map to or a vector of values if there are several. It can also map to several types of nodes at the same time.

Let&#39;s take a look at a more complex example of a mapping:

```julia
mapping = Dict(
    "Scene" => ToyDegreeDaysCumulModel(),
    "Plant" => (
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyLAIModel(),
            mapping=[
                :TT_cu => "Scene",
            ],
        ),
        Beer(0.6),
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyCAllocationModel(),
            mapping=[
                :carbon_assimilation => ["Leaf"],
                :carbon_demand => ["Leaf", "Internode"],
                :carbon_allocation => ["Leaf", "Internode"]
            ],
        ),
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyPlantRmModel(),
            mapping=[:Rm_organs => ["Leaf" => :Rm, "Internode" => :Rm],],
        ),
    ),
    "Internode" => (
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyCDemandModel(optimal_biomass=10.0, development_duration=200.0),
            mapping=[:TT => "Scene",],
        ),
        ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel(1.5, 0.06, 25.0, 0.6, 0.004),
        Status(carbon_biomass=1.0),
    ),
    "Leaf" => (
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyAssimModel(),
            mapping=[:soil_water_content => "Soil", :aPPFD => "Plant"],
        ),
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyCDemandModel(optimal_biomass=10.0, development_duration=200.0),
            mapping=[:TT => "Scene",],
        ),
        ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel(2.1, 0.06, 25.0, 1.0, 0.025),
        Status(carbon_biomass=0.5),
    ),
    "Soil" => (
        ToySoilWaterModel(),
    ),
);
```


In this example, we expect to make a simulation at five different scales: `"Scene"`, `"Plant"`, `"Internode"`, `"Leaf"`, and `"Soil"`. The `"Scene"` scale represents the whole scene, where one or several plants can live. The `"Plant"` scale is, well, the whole plant scale, `"Internode"` and `"Leaf"` are organ scales, and `"Soil"` is the soil scale. This mapping is used to compute the carbon allocation (`ToyCAllocationModel`) to the different organs of the plant (`"Leaf"` and `"Internode"`) from the assimilation at the `"Leaf"` scale (_i.e._ the offer) and their carbon demand (`ToyCDemandModel`). The `"Soil"` scale is used to compute the soil water content (`ToySoilWaterModel`), which is needed to calculate the assimilation at the `"Leaf"` scale (`ToyAssimModel`). We also can note that we compute the maintenance respiration at the `"Leaf"` and `"Internode"` scales (`ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel`), which is summed up to compute the total maintenance respiration at the `"Plant"` scale (`ToyPlantRmModel`). 

We see that all scales are interconnected, with computations at the organ scale that may depend on the soil scale and at the plant scale that depends on the organ scale and scene scale.

Something important to note here is that we have different ways to define the mapping for the `MultiScaleModel`. For example, we have `:carbon_assimilation => ["Leaf"]` at the plant scale for `ToyCAllocationModel`. This mapping means that the variable `carbon_assimilation` is mapped to the `"Leaf"` scale. However, we could also have `:carbon_assimilation => "Leaf"`, which is not completely equivalent.

::: tip Note

Note the difference between `:carbon_assimilation => ["Leaf"]` and `:carbon_assimilation => "Leaf"` is that &quot;Leaf&quot; is given as a vector in the first definition, and as a scalar in the second one.

:::

The difference is that the first one maps to a vector of values, while the second one maps to a single value. The first one is useful when we don&#39;t know how many nodes there will be in the plant of type `"Leaf"`. In this case, the values are available as a vector in the `carbon_assimilation` variable of the `status` inside the model. The second one should only be used if we are sure that there will be only one node at this scale, and in this case, the one and single value is given as a scalar in the `carbon_assimilation` variable of the `status` inside the model.

A third form for the mapping would be `:carbon_assimilation => ["Leaf", "Internode"]`. This form is useful when we need values for a variable from several scales simultaneously. In this case, the values are available as a vector in the `carbon_assimilation` variable of the `status` inside the model, sorted in the same order as nodes are traversed in the graph.

A last form is to map to a specific variable name at the target scale, _e.g._ `:Rm_organs => ["Leaf" => :Rm, "Internode" => :Rm]`. This form is useful when the variable name is different between scales, and we want to map to a specific variable name at the target scale. In this example, the variable `Rm_organs` at plant scale takes its values (is mapped) from the variable `Rm` at the `"Leaf"` and `"Internode"` scales.

## Running a simulation {#Running-a-simulation}

Now that we have a valid mapping, we can run a simulation. Running a multiscale simulation requires two more things compared to what we saw previously: a plant graph and the definition of the output variables we want dynamically for each scale.

### Plant graph {#Plant-graph}

We can import an example multi-scale tree graph like so:

```julia
mtg = import_mtg_example()
```


```
/ 1: Scene
â”œâ”€ / 2: Soil
â””â”€ + 3: Plant
   â””â”€ / 4: Internode
      â”œâ”€ + 5: Leaf
      â””â”€ < 6: Internode
         â””â”€ + 7: Leaf

```


::: tip Note

You can use `import_mtg_example` only if you previously imported the `Examples` sub-module of PlantSimEngine, _i.e._ `using PlantSimEngine.Examples`.

:::

This graph has a root node that defines a scene, then a soil, and a plant with two internodes and two leaves.

### Output variables {#Output-variables}

Models can access only one time step at a time, so the output at the end of a simulation is only the last time step. However, we can define a list of variables we want to get dynamically for each time step and each scale. This list is given as a dictionary with the name of the scale as the key and a vector of variables as the value. For example, we can define a list of variables we want to get at each time step for different scales as follows:

```julia
outs = Dict(
    "Scene" => (:TT, :TT_cu, :node),
    "Plant" => (:aPPFD, :LAI),
    "Leaf" => (:carbon_assimilation, :carbon_demand, :carbon_allocation, :TT),
    "Internode" => (:carbon_allocation,),
    "Soil" => (:soil_water_content,),
)
```


```
Dict{String, Tuple{Symbol, Vararg{Symbol}}} with 5 entries:
  "Soil"      => (:soil_water_content,)
  "Internode" => (:carbon_allocation,)
  "Scene"     => (:TT, :TT_cu, :node)
  "Plant"     => (:aPPFD, :LAI)
  "Leaf"      => (:carbon_assimilation, :carbon_demand, :carbon_allocation, :TT)
```


These variables will be available in the `outputs` field of the simulation object, with a value for each time step. 

### Meteorological data {#Meteorological-data}

As for mono-scale models, we need to provide meteorological data to run a simulation. We can use the `PlantMeteo` package to generate some dummy data for two time steps:

```julia
meteo = Weather(
    [
    Atmosphere(T=20.0, Wind=1.0, Rh=0.65, Ri_PAR_f = 200.0),
    Atmosphere(T=25.0, Wind=0.5, Rh=0.8, Ri_PAR_f = 180.0)
]
)
```


```
TimeStepTable{Atmosphere{(:date, :duration,...}(2 x 22):
â•­â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€

                                                              17 columns omitted

```


### Simulation {#Simulation}

Let&#39;s make a simulation using the graph and outputs we just defined:

```julia
sim = run!(mtg, mapping, meteo, outputs = outs);
```


```
â”Œ Warning: A parallel executor was provided (`executor=ThreadedEx()`) but the model PlantSimEngine.Examples.ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel{Float64}(2.1, 0.06, 25.0, 1.0, 0.025) (or its hard dependencies) cannot be run in parallel over objects. The simulation will be run sequentially. Use `executor=SequentialEx()` to remove this warning.
â”” @ PlantSimEngine ~/work/PlantSimEngine.jl/PlantSimEngine.jl/src/run.jl:465
```


And that&#39;s it! 

We can now access the outputs for each scale as a dictionary of vectors of values per variable and scale like this:

```julia
outputs(sim);
```


Or as a `DataFrame` using the `DataFrames` package:

```julia
using DataFrames
outputs(sim, DataFrame)
```


The values for the last time-step of the simulation are also available from the statuses:

```julia
status(sim);
```


This is a dictionary with the scale as the key and a vector of `Status` as values, one per node of that scale. So, in this example, the `"Leaf"` scale has two nodes, so the value is a vector of two `Status` objects, and the `"Soil"` scale has only one node, so the value is a vector of one `Status` object.

## Avoiding cyclic dependencies {#Avoiding-cyclic-dependencies}

When defining a mapping between models and scales, it is important to avoid cyclic dependencies. A cyclic dependency occurs when a model at a given scale depends on a model at another scale that depends on the first model. Cyclic dependencies are bad because they lead to an infinite loop in the simulation (the dependency graph keeps cycling indefinitely).

PlantSimEngine will detect cyclic dependencies and raise an error if one is found. The error message indicates the models involved in the cycle, and the model that is causing the cycle will be highlighted in red.

For example the following mapping will raise an error:

::: tip Details

&lt;summary&gt;Example mapping&lt;/summary&gt;

```julia
mapping_cyclic = Dict(
    "Plant" => (
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyCAllocationModel(),
            mapping=[
                :carbon_demand => ["Leaf", "Internode"],
                :carbon_allocation => ["Leaf", "Internode"]
            ],
        ),
        MultiScaleModel(
            model=ToyPlantRmModel(),
            mapping=[:Rm_organs => ["Leaf" => :Rm, "Internode" => :Rm],],
        ),
        Status(total_surface=0.001, aPPFD=1300.0, soil_water_content=0.6),
    ),
    "Internode" => (
        ToyCDemandModel(optimal_biomass=10.0, development_duration=200.0),
        ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel(1.5, 0.06, 25.0, 0.6, 0.004),
        Status(TT=10.0, carbon_biomass=1.0),
    ),
    "Leaf" => (
        ToyCDemandModel(optimal_biomass=10.0, development_duration=200.0),
        ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel(2.1, 0.06, 25.0, 1.0, 0.025),
        ToyCBiomassModel(1.2),
        Status(TT=10.0),
    )
)
```


:::

Let&#39;s see what happens when we try to build the dependency graph for this mapping:

```julia
julia> dep(mapping_cyclic)
ERROR: Cyclic dependency detected in the graph. Cycle:
 Plant: ToyPlantRmModel
 â”” Leaf: ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel
  â”” Leaf: ToyCBiomassModel
   â”” Plant: ToyCAllocationModel
    â”” Plant: ToyPlantRmModel

 You can break the cycle using the `PreviousTimeStep` variable in the mapping.
```


How can we interpret the message? We have a list of five models involved in the cycle. The first model is the one causing the cycle, and the others are the ones that depend on it. In this case, the `ToyPlantRmModel` is the one causing the cycle, and the others are inter-dependent. We can read this as follows:
1. `ToyPlantRmModel` depends on `ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel`, the plant-scale respiration sums up all organs respiration;
  
1. `ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel` depends on `ToyCBiomassModel`, the organs respiration depends on the organs biomass;
  
1. `ToyCBiomassModel` depends on `ToyCAllocationModel`, the organs biomass depends on the organs carbon allocation;
  
1. And finally `ToyCAllocationModel` depends on `ToyPlantRmModel` again, hence the cycle because the carbon allocation depends on the plant scale respiration.
  

The models can not be ordered in a way that satisfies all dependencies, so the cycle can not be broken. To solve this issue, we need to re-think how models are mapped together, and break the cycle.

There are several ways to break a cyclic dependency:
- **Merge models**: If two models depend on each other because they need _e.g._ recursive computations, they can be merged into a third model that handles the computation and takes the two models as hard dependencies. Hard dependencies are models that are explicitly called by another model and do not participate on the building of the dependency graph.
  
- **Change models**: Of course models can be interchanged to avoid cyclic dependencies, but this is not really a solution, it is more a workaround.
  
- **PreviousTimeScale**: We can break the dependency graph by defining some variables as taken from the previous time step. A very well known example is the computation of the light interception by a plant that depends on the leaf area, which is usually the result of a model that also depends on the light interception. The cyclic dependency is usually broken by using the leaf area from the previous time step in the interception model, which is a good approximation for most cases.
  

We can fix our previous mapping by computing the organs respiration using the carbon biomass from the previous time step instead. Let&#39;s see how to fix the cyclic dependency in our mapping (look at the leaf and internode scales):

    );
nothing # hide

:::

The `ToyMaintenanceRespirationModel` models are now defined as `MultiScaleModel`, and the `carbon_biomass` variable is wrapped in a `PreviousTimeStep` structure. This structure tells PlantSimEngine to take the value of the variable from the previous time step, breaking the cyclic dependency.

::: tip Note

`PreviousTimeStep` tells PlantSimEngine to take the value of the previous time step for the variable it wraps, or the value at initialization for the first time step. The value at initialization is the one provided by default in the models inputs, but is usually provided in the `Status` structure to override this default. A `PreviousTimeStep` is used to wrap the **input** variable of a model, with or without a mapping to another scale _e.g._ `Previous(:carbon_biomass) => "Leaf"`.

### Wrapping up {#Wrapping-up}

In this section, we saw how to define a mapping between models and scales, run a simulation, and access the outputs.

This is just a simple example, but PlantSimEngine can be used to define and combine much more complex models at multiple scales of detail. With its modular architecture and intuitive API, PlantSimEngine is a powerful tool for multi-scale plant growth and development modeling.

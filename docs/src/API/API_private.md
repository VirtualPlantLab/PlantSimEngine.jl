# API - internal functions
## Un-exported

Private functions, types or constants from `PlantSimEngine`. These are not exported, so you need to use `PlantSimEngine.` to access them (*e.g.* `PlantSimEngine.DataFormat`). Most of them are developer code, but some may be useful for tinkerers, or to have greater control over some simulation parameters (future versions of this documentation might break those categories into separate pages for clarity).

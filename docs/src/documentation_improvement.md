# Help improve our documentation !

One goal for PlantSimEngine is to ensure testing ecophysiological hypotheses, or building plant simulations is as easy as can be for a wider range of people than previous frameworks.

Good documentation is essential for that purpose.

If parts of the documentation are unclear to you, you are very welcome to send a PR, an email, or a message (either on Github or on Discourse : TODO) so that we can improve upon it.

# Help improve our documentation !

One goal for PlantSimEngine is to ensure testing ecophysiological hypotheses, or building plant simulations is as easy as can be for a wider range of people than previous frameworks.

Good documentation is essential for that purpose.

If parts of the documentation are unclear to you, you are very welcome to send a PR, an email, or a message (either [on Github](https://github.com/VirtualPlantLab/PlantSimEngine.jl/issues) or [on the FSPM Discourse](https://fspm.discourse.group/latest)) so that we can improve upon it.

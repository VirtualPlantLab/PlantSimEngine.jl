PlantSimEngine arose out of a perceived need for a new modelling framework for ecophysiological and FSPM simulations.

## Goals

## Existing FSPM systems

### Monoliths
Often massive codebases
Rigid
Implicit hypothesis
Parameters hard to change

### Distributed systems

two-language problem

### other tools

Architectural primary focus
Adding functional and environmental models is less straightforward
C++, Java, less accessible
User interface
Less tailored to autonomous 'researcher-developer', requires a 'developer-modeller'

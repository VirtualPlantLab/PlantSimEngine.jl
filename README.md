WIP package that enforce a single API for models related to plants, soil and atmosphere. It helps defining and running processes with any implementation (*i.e.* model), at any scale.

## Overview

`PlantSimEngine` defines a framework for declaring processes and implementing associated models for their simulation. The package focuses on key aspects of simulation and modelling:

- easy definition of new processes, which can really be any process such as light interception, photosynthesis, growth, soil water transfer...
- easy, interactive prototyping of models, with constraints to help users avoid errors, but sensible defaults to avoid over-complicating the model writing process
- no hassle, the package manages automatically input and output variables, time-steps, objects, model coupling, and model switching
- (very) fast computing, think of 100th of nanoseconds for the full energy balance of a leaf (see [PlantBiophysics.jl](https://github.com/VEZY/PlantBiophysics.jl) that uses PlantSimEngine)
- easily scalable, with methods for computing over objects, time-steps and even [Multi-Scale Tree Graphs](https://github.com/VEZY/MultiScaleTreeGraph.jl)
- composable: use [Unitful](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) to propagate units, use [MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl) to propagate measurement error

## Installation

To install the package, enter the Julia package manager mode by pressing `]` in the REPL, and execute the following command:

```julia
add PlantSimEngine
```

To use the package, execute this command from the Julia REPL:

```julia
using PlantSimEngine
```

## Projects that use PlantSimEngine

Take a look at these projects that use PlantSimEngine:

- [PlantBiophysics.jl](https://github.com/VEZY/PlantBiophysics.jl)
- [XPalm](https://github.com/PalmStudio/XPalm.jl)

## Make it yours 

The package is developed so anyone can easily implement plant/crop models, use it freely and as you want thanks to its MIT license. 

If you develop such tools and it is not on the list yet, please make a PR or contact me so we can add it! ðŸ˜ƒ

## More details

Defining a new processes is done with `@gen_gen_process_methods`, which creates automatically:

- the base function of the process, *e.g.* `energy_balance!_()`
- the user interfaces, *e.g.* `energy_balance!()` and `energy_balance()`
- the abstract process type, used as a supertype of all models implementations, *e.g.* `AbstractEnergy_BalanceModel`
- the documentation for all the above
- a basic tutorial on how to make a model implementation 

Then, modelers are encouraged to implement their models to simulate the process following a set of basic simple rules enforced by the package.  

You'll find more details on the documentation of the package.

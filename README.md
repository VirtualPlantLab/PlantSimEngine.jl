## Overview

`PlantSimEngine` is a package for the simulation and modelling of plants, soil and atmosphere. It is designed to help researchers and practitioners prototype, implement, test plant/crop models at any scale, without the hassle of computer science technicality behind model coupling, running on several time-steps or objects.

The package defines a framework for declaring processes and implementing associated models for their simulation. 

It focuses on key aspects of simulation and modeling such as: 

- easy definition of new processes, such as light interception, photosynthesis, growth, soil water transfer...
- fast, interactive prototyping of models, with constraints to help users avoid errors, but sensible defaults to avoid over-complicating the model writing process
- no hassle, the package manages automatically input and output variables, time-steps, objects, soft and hard coupling of models with a dependency graph
- switch between models without changing any code, with a simple syntax to define the model to use for a given process
- Reduce the degrees of freedom by fixing variables, passing measurements, or using a simpler model for a given process
- ðŸš€(very) fast computation ðŸš€, think of 100th of nanoseconds for the full energy balance of a leaf using [PlantBiophysics.jl](https://github.com/VEZY/PlantBiophysics.jl) that uses PlantSimEngine
- Out of the box Sequential, Parallel (Multi-threaded) or Distributed (Multi-Process) computations over objects, time-steps and independent processes (thanks to [Floops.jl](https://juliafolds.github.io/FLoops.jl/stable/))
- easily scalable, with methods for computing over objects, time-steps and even [Multi-Scale Tree Graphs](https://github.com/VEZY/MultiScaleTreeGraph.jl)
- composable, allowing the use of any types as inputs such as [Unitful](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) to propagate units, or [MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl) to propagate measurement error

## Make it yours 

The package is developed so anyone can easily implement plant/crop models, use it freely and as you want thanks to its MIT license. 

If you develop such tools and it is not on the list yet, please make a PR or contact me so we can add it! ðŸ˜ƒ


## TO DO

- [ ] Look into locks for parallel computations over "independent" processes that can maybe call a model when both parents are being computed, so both are set to 0 and the model is never called
